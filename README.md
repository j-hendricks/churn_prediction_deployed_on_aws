# churn_prediction_deployed_on_aws
In this repo, I ran code from an AWS tutorial that involves predicting customer churn with XGBoost. I only made slight changes to the code, such as adding my own comments in markdown. 

The tutorial can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-tune-and-deploy-an-end-to-end-churn-prediction-model-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines/
